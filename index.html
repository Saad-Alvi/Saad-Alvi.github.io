</p>


Since a young age I have been in the workforce. Slowly becoming more experienced with my work I noticed that I would need to educate myself beyond a high school level. <br>
Many of my problems arise from trying to learn how to maintain the business, keeping up with the finances and making critical decisions. At this stage of my life I found <br> 
that the best thing for me would be to do a Bachelors course in Financial Planning. This would be helping me directly in my work. I decided to go through my options as I <br>
have to go in to work from Monday to Friday even the weekends sometime. Working nine to five can be a lot of work and trying to go into class would be near impossible. <br>
So I decided to take up Open University. This would help me work and I would still be able to do my course. After finishing my course I feel as if I would have a lot more <br>
skill set to bring into my future problems. I will be able to help myself personally and career wise.

<p>
Growing up I have always loved education. Coming from a well-educated family my parents have always made education my first priority. My father started his own International <br>
Business Colleges in Sydney. Since the age of sixteen I have helped my father run the college. As I established myself more in the industry I noticed that my own education will <br> 
play a big part in my future as I would see many international students and the tough times they would have to go through to integrate into the new society. Now tha t I have <br>
taken over the day to day task of the business I have realised that financial planning will help me not only flourish in this industry but in every business venture I would like <br>
 to make in the future. Being the Chief Financial Officer of my own company or even working for a big company would be the best outcome.

<p>
This Job will mainly deal with compliance in building and also dealing with the businesses financial projects. This is a Chief Financial Officer position (CFO). <br>
  Already having a background in a management position in my life from a young age this has helped mould my personal attributes. Using this and finishing my course <br>
 this will be an ideal position for me. Also knowing that all other board members are living in the state and available makes having meeting about important matters <br>
 much easier. Also growing up I have also worked in construction and done it in year 12 for my final year of school. A lot of my close friends are doing construction <br>
 and I gave kept up with problems in the industry. 

I would need minimum a bachelor in finance also past experiences of 10 years. Also I would need to learn about construction law I feel best thing would be to have a builders <br>
 license or bachelors in Construction management. I have already done 1 year of construction management in my first year of university. This allows me to understand the course <br>
 and know what I will need to do.I should also be friendly with accounting problems since there will be a lot of accounting issues on the job. Only way to be able to make curial <br>
 decisions for the business would be through knowledge of the problems. I feel with my current attributes and finishing my studies in the future I can become an ideal candidate. <br>
 Having done management and making decisions for my father&#8217;s business I feel like with the right knowledge I can really help this business grow. I already have 1 year in <br>
construction management bachelor and also am currently finishing my financial planning bachelor. I feel like I can really fill this position out well.

<p>
For the Myers Briggs Test I scored in the INFP. I feel as if I don&#8217;t yearn to embrace change with open arms. This can both be good and bad attribute. I always love coming up with <br>
new ideas or a new way to do something which gives it a more personal feeling. An example of this could be that I have had the same group of close friends for over 10 years. I <br>
have no trouble meeting new people but would rather stick with my group of friends. I have come up with many small business ventures with this group of friends that has helped us <br>
in the past but at the same time this hasn&#8217;t allowed me to get new or fresh ideas since I have stuck to the same group of friends with similar mind sets to mine own. <br>

From the Learning style test I found out that I am in the auditory learners. This has showed me that it would be best for me to be in a team willing to have many meetings and talk <br>
 about our individual tasks and how we will complete the project. I won&#8217;t mind taking lead in a project as long as other members participate in group activities. A lot of discussions <br>
would be made for the most ideal results. I agree with this, since I have always liked to get many different opinions before making a crucial discussion in my life. I like to assess all <br>
the options available by trying to link it with other people&#8217;s experiences. This helps me listen and understand to where I stand in my own situation.

The big 5 learning test showed where I stood for 5 different personal attributes. Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism. I scored highest in <br> 
Extraversion showing me that I always liked to include my friends in plans and business ventures. Always finding it easier to use people I know and helping them by letting them <br>
join in the venture and helping me. This allows the work load on myself to become easier and also I can help someone I trust. I scored lowest on Conscientiousness this displays that <br>
 I would choose to work with someone I know because I know they will always be on my back about moving forward in the project. They won&#8217;t be hesitant to call me late at night. Having a  <br>
constant push to come to a conclusion for a decision really helps me stay focused.  The other attributes I scored fairly average showing that I don&#8217;t swing much to any side most likely 
depends on how urgent the project is.

<h2> Overview</h2>
<p>
This is a report showing how Austcorp or any other construction company should start taking step towards becoming more eco-friendly. The best and newest way for construction companies to start <br>
 taking these steps is by using eco-friendly material also known as Sustainable Building. This is done by using natural material such as wood. Using technology and skills we have learnt over the <br>
 years we can build a cost effect ad ecofriendly building. This report shows us the basics on how we can move towards becoming more ecofriendly 
 </p>
 <h2> Motivation</h2>
 <p>
 One of the biggest issue in Construction currently is Eco friendly construction material (Sustainable Building).  The ASEAN region is set to grow 5.4% each year for the next 10 years which is <br>
 equivalent to the fifth largest economy. Saying this Australia will construct more than 40 million square meters of certified green building space by 2020. Saying this Austcorp Pty Ltd should <br>
 follow. Because of this it will give us many benefits such as good face and also the main problem of helping the environment. Every year the Laws on construction is getting tougher specially <br>
 on Sustainable Building, If we take an early step towards this it will be more convenient for us to adjust to future Compliance changes.
</p>
<h2> Description</h2>
<p>
What is sustainable building? Sustainable building can be categorised in some simple ways such as   helping keep and protecting the environmental resources that surround the job site. Minimising <br>
 pollution degradation and trash while we are constructing. Using energy to the best of its ability. Protecting the community around the job site. We can also see a longer life expectancy in houses <br>
 using these materials also the owners can have a more cost effect renovation since we are using natural materials. General utility will be cheaper such as gas, oil and even water. While helping the <br>
 environment and society around it. Also at the end of the building life expectancy we can recycle all the material used in the building. While this is still fairly new to the industry standards around <br>
 the world are slowly pushing towards having it. This will also allow the company to help standards move forward towards these goals. 

These Points can be seen by a project done in Norway. The Treet (The Tree) project has shown the world how sustainable building is not helping the environment but also cost effective. This is a high-rise <br> 
building which made mostly by wood by using prefabrication materials. The recognition of building the world&#8217;s largest high rise wood building gave the company a big boost and now has changed the world of <br>
 construction. Also the company who made this building was awarded many different awards some being. Wood construction of the year and prefab house of the year. This has made this company an eco-friendly <br>
 household name in the construction industry 

Austcorp can slowly integrate this into their future building plans by starting off slow. This would not only change the way Australia portrays the company but would have a world-wide recognition. Also <br>
allowing the Customers to be happy because of a more affordable way of living. By building house from Eco friendly materials we allow them to not only be able have less renovations but also more affordable <br>
 renovations. Also having features such as internal heating systems connected to a larger heating system within the house can hold back on individual housing energy. Our eco-friendly buildings will also leave <br>
 a very meniscal carbon footprint not only in the building cycle but if the whole houses life expectancy because we will be able to recycle most of the materials used in the building. Being more cost effect for <br>
 Austcorp will save us money time and labour which are the three main expensive the company will have. Also coming to the fact that laws in local and international industry are changing to support these <br>
 Austcorp will not only ahead of its competition but ready for any changes made by the government.  
</p>
<h2> Tools and Technologies</h2>
<p>
Best thing about Sustainable building is that all resources needed are natural such as using wooden beams to construct a house or a building  in the past we didn&#8217;t have the technology to calculate how we can <br>
use wood and concert slabs to stabilise and make the living conditions possible. By using softwares such as Arcarhicad we can make a 3D visuals of the houses we are going to make and see if it is possible for it <br>
to be stable and liveable. Because of softwares like these we are able to see many outcomes in the industry
</p>
<h2> Skill Required </h2>
<p>
Austcorp already has most of materials needed. The company has softwares that are used to design houses. Also the company already uses all the materials needed such as glass, wood and concert. All the company needs <br>
 would need to do is understand how to calculate the best way to build houses using these materials only. Using projects like the Treet and other similar projects we can learn the exact resources necessary to build <br>
 what the company needs. 
</p>
<h2> Outcome</h2>
<p>
Well the most important outcome that will come from this will be decreasing our carbon footprint helping the environment and the society the building is in. Also the recognition Austcorp will get by taking the step <br>
 forward in construction will boost the company&#8217;s image. Furthermore helping give customers a more affordable lifestyle can really change Australian economy and how the construction industry is seen in Australia. This <br>
 improvement can really help the company make the right steps to takes Austcorp to the next level.
