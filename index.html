Since a young age I have been in the workforce. Slowly becoming more experienced with my work I noticed that I would need to educate myself beyond a high school level. <br>
Many of my problems arise from trying to learn how to maintain the business, keeping up with the finances and making critical decisions. At this stage of my life I found <br> 
that the best thing for me would be to do a Bachelors course in Financial Planning. This would be helping me directly in my work. I decided to go through my options as I <br>
have to go in to work from Monday to Friday even the weekends sometime. Working nine to five can be a lot of work and trying to go into class would be near impossible. <br>
So I decided to take up Open University. This would help me work and I would still be able to do my course. After finishing my course I feel as if I would have a lot more <br>
skill set to bring into my future problems. I will be able to help myself personally and career wise.

<p>
Growing up I have always loved education. Coming from a well-educated family my parents have always made education my first priority. My father started his own International <br>
Business Colleges in Sydney. Since the age of sixteen I have helped my father run the college. As I established myself more in the industry I noticed that my own education will <br> 
play a big part in my future as I would see many international students and the tough times they would have to go through to integrate into the new society. Now tha t I have <br>
taken over the day to day task of the business I have realised that financial planning will help me not only flourish in this industry but in every business venture I would like <br>
 to make in the future. Being the Chief Financial Officer of my own company or even working for a big company would be the best outcome.

This Job will mainly deal with compliance in building and also dealing with the businesses financial projects. This is a Chief Financial Officer position (CFO). <br>
  Already having a background in a management position in my life from a young age this has helped mould my personal attributes. Using this and finishing my course <br>
 this will be an ideal position for me. Also knowing that all other board members are living in the state and available makes having meeting about important matters <br>
 much easier. Also growing up I have also worked in construction and done it in year 12 for my final year of school. A lot of my close friends are doing construction <br>
 and I gave kept up with problems in the industry. 

I would need minimum a bachelor in finance also past experiences of 10 years. Also I would need to learn about construction law I feel best thing would be to have a builders <br>
 license or bachelors in Construction management. I have already done 1 year of construction management in my first year of university. This allows me to understand the course <br>
 and know what I will need to do.I should also be friendly with accounting problems since there will be a lot of accounting issues on the job. Only way to be able to make curial <br>
 decisions for the business would be through knowledge of the problems. I feel with my current attributes and finishing my studies in the future I can become an ideal candidate. <br>
 Having done management and making decisions for my father’s business I feel like with the right knowledge I can really help this business grow. I already have 1 year in <br>
construction management bachelor and also am currently finishing my financial planning bachelor. I feel like I can really fill this position out well.

<p>
For the Myers Briggs Test I scored in the INFP. I feel as if I don’t yearn to embrace change with open arms. This can both be good and bad attribute. I always love coming up with <br>
new ideas or a new way to do something which gives it a more personal feeling. An example of this could be that I have had the same group of close friends for over 10 years. I <br>
have no trouble meeting new people but would rather stick with my group of friends. I have come up with many small business ventures with this group of friends that has helped us <br>
in the past but at the same time this hasn’t allowed me to get new or fresh ideas since I have stuck to the same group of friends with similar mind sets to mine own. <br>

From the Learning style test I found out that I am in the auditory learners. This has showed me that it would be best for me to be in a team willing to have many meetings and talk <br>
 about our individual tasks and how we will complete the project. I won’t mind taking lead in a project as long as other members participate in group activities. A lot of discussions <br>
would be made for the most ideal results. I agree with this, since I have always liked to get many different opinions before making a crucial discussion in my life. I like to assess all <br>
the options available by trying to link it with other people’s experiences. This helps me listen and understand to where I stand in my own situation.

The big 5 learning test showed where I stood for 5 different personal attributes. Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism. I scored highest in <br> 
Extraversion showing me that I always liked to include my friends in plans and business ventures. Always finding it easier to use people I know and helping them by letting them <br>
join in the venture and helping me. This allows the work load on myself to become easier and also I can help someone I trust. I scored lowest on Conscientiousness this displays that <br>
 I would choose to work with someone I know because I know they will always be on my back about moving forward in the project. They won’t be hesitant to call me late at night. Having a  <br>
constant push to come to a conclusion for a decision really helps me stay focused.  The other attributes I scored fairly average showing that I don’t swing much to any side most likely 
depends on how urgent the project is.
